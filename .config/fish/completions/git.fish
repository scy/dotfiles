# This file disables the builtin Git completion of the fish shell, because it's
# too damn slow, especially when completing file names after `git add`.
# After upgrading to fish >= 3.0, I should re-evaluate the speed, because
# according to fish-shell/fish-shell#4673, speed has improved significantly.
