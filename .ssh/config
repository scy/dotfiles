# Load additional configs in ~/.ssh/config.d. These are host-specific configs. Hosts that I want to keep private are in
# files that are not added to Git, at least not to _this_ repository. Since OpenSSH uses the _first_ value it finds,
# host-specific things should come at the beginning, fallbacks towards the end of the file.
# `Include` is available since OpenSSH 7.3p1.

# My known_hosts management works like this:
#   * Host configs include a snippet from ~/.ssh/snippet/ that chooses the UserKnownHostsFile for them. I have some
#     public hosts (like GitHub), some private ones and some for my employer's hosts. These non-public host keys and the
#     configs are stored in different repositories (and symlinked) or even just on the local machine.
#   * known_hosts is supposed to be empty; only hosts that don't have a `Host` configuration will be put there. If
#     changes to known_hosts pop up in `git status`, I know that I have to tidy that up.
#   * Since I'm using `Host` configs with user/host in them anyway and since I want to be able to tidy up my known_hosts
#     files manually, I don't hash the known hosts files.
