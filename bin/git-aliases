# List Git aliases in a somewhat beautiful way. This mainly strips the “alias.”
# prefix, adds color, and pipes the output to `column`, so that it doesn’t have
# to rely on the tab character. However, there’s a fallback to `cat` if `column`
# is not available on this system.

# Please note that this file contains literal escape and tab characters inside
# of strings.
